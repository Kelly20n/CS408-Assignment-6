# CS408-Assignment-6

Introduction
The project uses a height map to create a texturized landscape. Using a particle generator I alter the height map where the particles are landing to create a local heightened
area

How to run
To run my project you will have to download the contents by clicking the green code button and downloading zip file.

Once done that you will unzip that file and open your program environment and create a new C++ project. I personally use Visual Studio 2022. Once your new project is
created you will need to take the contents of the zip folder and place them in the project folder wherever that is on your computer. Make sure that everything stays in 
one folder or else it won't run. If you use visual studio 2022 you will need to go to solution explorer and add existing items, make sure to add all files except .obj files.
Upon running a stream of particles will come down from the emitting location, where the particles land the height map will be altered, the user can move the emitter around
using the WASD keys.
